# Application of CFG in Syntactic Parsing
This project demonstrates the application of Context-Free Grammars (CFG) in syntactic parsing using Python and Streamlit. It utilizes the CYK algorithm to parse sentences based on a defined CFG and presents the results in an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Streamlit.

# Key Features
CFG Implementation: The project effectively implements a CFG to represent the grammatical structure of a language.

CYK Algorithm Integration: It seamlessly integrates the CYK algorithm to efficiently parse sentences based on the defined CFG.

Streamlit GUI: The project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive GUI, allowing users to input sentences and visualize the parsing results.

# Project Setup
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip.

Run the Application: Execute the main Python script to launch the Streamlit application.

# Usage
Input Sentence: Enter a sentence in the designated text field.

Parse Sentence: Click the "Parse" button to trigger the parsing process.

View Results: Observe the parsed sentence structure displayed in the GUI.

# Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates the application of CFGs in syntactic parsing using Python and Streamlit. It provides an interactive and educational tool for understanding the concepts of syntactic analysis and natural language processing.
