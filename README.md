# Application of CFG in Syntactic Parsing
# Description:
This project aims to develop a tool that checks whether Indonesian sentences have a standard and correct structure according to Indonesian grammar rules. It utilizes Context-Free Grammars (CFG) to analyze the syntactic structure of sentences and identify any grammatical errors. The tool also generates a triangular construction table to visualize the parsing process.

# Technologies:

Python: Programming language for implementing the CFG-based parsing algorithm
Streamlit: Python library for creating interactive web applications
CFG: Formal grammar framework for defining Indonesian syntax rules

# Features:
Checks Indonesian sentences for grammatical correctness
Generates a triangular construction table for each parsed sentence
Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting and analyzing sentences

# Benefits:
Improves Indonesian language proficiency by identifying and correcting grammatical errors
Enhances understanding of Indonesian sentence structure
Provides a valuable tool for Indonesian language learners and educators

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine
Install the required dependencies (Python, Streamlit)
Run the main script (e.g., main.py)
Use the web interface to input and analyze Indonesian sentences

# Conclusion:
This project provides a practical application of CFGs for syntactic parsing of Indonesian sentences. It serves as a valuable tool for improving Indonesian language proficiency and understanding sentence structure.

View Results: Observe the parsed sentence structure displayed in the GUI.
